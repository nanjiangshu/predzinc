PREDZINC version 1.4, 2011-10-14

1. The formats of the database files: fragacc, modm and Qij, are changed 
   so that these files become much smaller. The speed of database reading becomes faster
   as a consequence. 

2. Options added:
   --seqfilelist  file : supply a file with a list of sequence files for tch mode prediction
   --pssmfilelist file : supply a file with a list of pssm files for batch de prediction
   so that the users can predict multiple entries at a time. 
   -cpu <int>          : the users can specify the number of cores to be used to run blastpgp

3. Environmental variables BLASTBIN and BLASTMAT are set to PREDZINC/bin and
   PREDZINC/data, respectively. The program blastpgp and makemat as well
   as BLOSUM62 are included in the PREDZINC package, so that the installation
   becomes simpler.

4. A new package which can be run in Windows under Cygwin
(http://www.cygwin.com/) is released

2011-10-14:
   PredZinc updated to version 1.4, 
   New featuers:
   1. The HTML output is updated. The predicted zinc-binding residues are
   highlighted and the homologous templates used in the prediction are listed.
   2. The input sequence file can be a Fasta file with multiple sequences.
      The option "--seqfilelist" is removed.
   3. Database for the training set are now stored in a dumped file instead of
   thousands of individual files
   4. One bug fixed for homology searching. Before the homology-based prediction
   was not merged in the final prediction due to a typo.
